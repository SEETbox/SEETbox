## SEETbox-SUHI-Effect-Evaluation-Toolbox

SEETbox can be connected to any ArcMap version and ArcGIS Pro by clicking “Add Toolbox” under the “Insert” tab, then browsing and opening the SEETbox.tbx file. The SEET model in the SEETbox is developed on the grid-based sampling system with 500x500m resolution. The SEET operates within a predefined geodatabase with seven datasets comprising three raster and four-vector data. Raster dataset covers (1) Landsat-8, band4, (2) Landsat-8, band5, (3) Landsat-8, band10, and vector dataset includes the polygons of (4) urbanised area boundary, (5) sample grid cell, (6) 2D building data including shape area, number of floors and a floor height information, and (7) 3D building data. The tool comprises six sub-tools, each functioning as distinct GIS extensions given in the SEETbox, for the assessment of the SUHI effect and morphological structure of an urban fabric. "SEETWorkspace01" contains the dataset utilized throughout the research, except the Landsat-8 imagery, which remains accessible via the publicly available USGS website.
